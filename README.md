# sql-challenge
module 9 assignment

Hello, 

This repository is for module 9 challenge for Washington University/edX Bootcamp.
Here we have a schema sql file to create tables appropriate for the sample employee, salary, department data provided in this excercise. 
In the folder labeled 'EmployeeSQL' please find the file 'Schema.sql' to find SQL scripts to create the tables. This will create the tables with proper relationships defined and connected by foreign keys. 

Once tables are created, you may find the csv files for each table in the 'data' folder. Once your tables are created you may import the data into the appropriate tables. 

Next, please find the file 'Data Analysis.sql'. This file has a number of queries to pull key sample sets of information based on various criteria.
